    "You have two options for completing your final project for this course. \n",

    "#### Option 1 ####\n",
    "The first option is presented in this notebook and involves implementing a Connect Four game with AB pruning and A* as player strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2 ####\n",
    "The second option is to design your own project that includes any of the algorithms we've discussed throughout the semester, or an algorithm that you're interested in learning that we haven't discussed in class. Your project also needs to include some kind of analysis of how it performed on a specific problem. If you're interested in the design your own project option, you need to discuss your idea with one of the course instructors to get approval. If you do a project without getting approval, you will receive a 0 regardless of the quality of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose EITHER the given problem to submit OR choose your own project topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you choose your own project topic, please adhere to the following guidelines:\n",
    "- Send an email to the course instructor before Wednesday, April 12, with a paragraph description of your project. I will respond in 24 hours.\n",
    "- The project can include an algorithm we've discussed throughout the semester or an algorithm that you're been curious to learn. Please don't recycle a project that you did in another class. \n",
    "- If you do your own project without prior approval, you will receive a 0 for this project.\n",
    "- Your project code, explanation, and results must all be contained in a Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. All work, code and analysis must be **your own**.\n",
    "4. You may use your course notes, posted lecture slides, textbook, in-class notebooks and homework solutions as resources.  You may also search online for answers to general knowledge questions, like the form of a probability distribution function, or how to perform a particular operation in Python. You may not use entire segments of code as solutions to any part of this project, e.g. if you find a Python implementation of policy iteration online, you can't use it.\n",
    "5. You may **not** post to message boards or other online resources asking for help.\n",
    "6. **You may not collaborate with classmates or anyone else.**\n",
    "7. This is meant to be like a coding portion of an exam. So, we will be much less helpful than we typically are with homework. For example, we will not check answers, help debug your code, and so on.\n",
    "8. If you have a question, post it first as a **private** Piazza message. If we decide that it is appropriate for the entire class, then we will make it a public post (and anonymous).\n",
    "9. If any part of the given project or your personal project is left open-ended, it is because we intend for you to code it up however you want. Our primary concern is with the plots/analysis that your code produces. Feel free to ask clarifying questions though.\n",

    "* `compute_utility(self, move, state)` calculates the utility of `state` that would result if `move` is made when the game is in the current `state`. This is where you want to check to see if anyone has gotten `nwin` in a row\n",
    "* `game_over(self, state)` returns `True` if the game in the given `state` has reached a terminal state, and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "* `utility(self, state, player)` returns the utility of the current state if the player is Red and $-1 \\cdot$ utility if the player is Black.\n",
    "* `display(self)` is a method to display the current game `state`. You get it for free because this would be super frustrating without it.\n",
    "* `play_game(self, player1, player2)` returns an integer that is the utility of the outcome of the game (+1 if Red wins, 0 if draw, -1 if Black wins). `player1` and `player2` are functional arguments that we will deal with in parts **1b** and **1d**.\n",

The increase in board size also causes a substantially larger amount of losses for the player. The draws are virtually non existent now. This is certainly due to the fact that there is a significantly larger board, allowing for an exponentially larger set of potential states.

    "Although we learned in class that AB pruning should take off at least 50%, it does significantly more here because of the utility function only allowing values of -1, 0, and 1. Because of this utility function, once AB has a value of 1 for a subtree (a win), it prunes all other subtrees in the game tree. As checked with Prof Dykes, this amount of savings is to be expected because of this philosophy. So, in this case, AB pruning is faster by more than 99%. "

This makes sure that my hueristic brings the A* search to the bottom of the tree first. When it arrives, if the utility is a 1, meaning the player will win, it does not have to look at any other parts of the tree. It essentially will examine terminal states, until a preferable utility is achieved. Since my path cost will be fixed for all nodes, I will choose a hueristic that increases as we get closer to the solution. This is because I would like for my path cost + hueristic cost to increase as I get closer to the goal state (3 in a row for Connect3). So, my hueristic will be the number of checkers on the board at a given state. This certainly will not be an amazing hueristic, but I wanted to compare an A* search with a poor search hueristic to these other players to see the outcome.\n",

This is because it is a deterministic algorithm, and should therefore be able to find a way to win in most states against a completely stochastic player. Furthermore, the draw makes sense because my hueristic was incredibly weak. Because of this weak hueristic, it makes sense that a random player might win or draw the game every once in a while. In terms of the astar vs alpha beta player, these results do not surprise me either. It is two determinstic algorithms battling it out. However, as stated before, the search hueristic is not a strong one for astar. When put up against a deterministic algorithm that is much stronger than it like alpha beta, it makes a lot of sense why it is never able to win. These two determinstic algorithms also output the same terminal state on every iteration.\n",

One that I was potentially thinking of is, how many potential game winning moves are available on the board. I do believe that this would be a stronger hueristic to base my findings off of. If I were to employ this different hueristic, I would have to believe that my astar would never lose to a random player, and that it may win some games against the alpha_beta player (although since they are both deterministic I might expect the result to be the same each time). To test this, I would probably want to alter the starting positions of each player to see if the outcomes changed."
