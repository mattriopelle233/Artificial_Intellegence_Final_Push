# Artificial_Intellegence_Final_Push

The following is my final project for my artifical intelligence class, coded in the spring semester of 2023 at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

It is a simple connect3 game, played in between AI generated computers which use different methods of search in order to achieve a victory.

They search through the game tree with AB pruning, an A* search hueristic, and also, at random.
